{"name":"Hackto","body":"# 80s Joke Line, a HackTO 2012 Entry.\r\n\r\nThis is a simple joke line. You can call a telephone number to hear a joke.\r\nAfter listening, you're given the option to leave a joke. If you visit the\r\nsite's home page, you will see a random joke.\r\n\r\nThis is all done using using [Flask][1] and the APIs from [Twilio][2] and\r\n[Soundcloud][3].\r\n\r\nThis was cobbled together over the course of a few hours. You can look at the\r\ncommit history to watch how it evolved. There are no tests. Lots of commits are\r\nstraight-up broken. There are lots of hacks and poor programming choices. So\r\nall in all it was a fun diversion for us all.\r\n\r\nThe \"demo\" tag marks the point where we had to stop working on the application.\r\nAt that time we were still serving things using the development server and\r\ntransferring audio from Twilio to Soundcloud within the request-response cycle\r\nof the web application.\r\n\r\nEnjoy.\r\n\r\n\r\n[1]: http://flask.pocoo.org/\r\n[2]: http://twilio.com/\r\n[3]: http://soundcloud.com/\r\n\r\n\r\n","tagline":"Mystery Hack TO Project: The '80s Joke Line.","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
